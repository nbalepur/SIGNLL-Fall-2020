# Special Interest Group for Natural Language Learning (SIGNLL) Projects

SIGNLL is an organization committed to the learning and exploration of various Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Topics. As one of the many subcommittees of the UIUC chapter of [ACM](acm.illinois.edu), we taught various lessons and walked through different Python projects to give a taste of this subfield of computer science. This repository contains the code and different materials for the Fall 2020 semester of SIGNLL

## Getting Started

To get the different projecs running on your machine, follow the steps below

### Installing and Opening Notebooks

First, run the following command to get the files on your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/nbalepur/SIGNLL-Fall-2020.git
```

The recommended IDE for these projects is `Jupyter Notebook`. My preferred installation method of `Jupyter Notebook` is with `Anaconda`

Instructions on how to install `Anaconda` can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Once `Anaconda` is installed, simply open up the application and type `"jupyter notebook"` into the terminal. From there, you should be able to navigate to your desired project file

### Additional Installations

Some projects require additional libraries to be installed, such as `Keras` and `Tensorflow` in the `Neural Networks` project

This can be accomplished fairly simply using `Anaconda Navigator`, instructions of which can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-tensorflow-and-keras-using-anaconda-navigator-without-command-line/)

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

An in-depth tutorial on how to run and navigate through `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

## Projects

Below you can find the different projects for SIGNLL:

### Intro to Python and NumPy

This week, we go through a brief description of NLP and the other projects we covered throughout the semester. We then showcase a notebook demo with a beginner's application to `Python` and `NumPy` We have also provided a notebook for extra practice with various `NumPy` functions and `Python` data structures. Finally, we give a brief demo of using what we've learned in a simple spam-detection model
