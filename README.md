# Special Interest Group for Natural Language Learning (SIGNLL) Projects

**To learn more about SIGNLL and see the projects for yourself, visit our website [here](https://nbalepur.github.io/SIGNLL-Fall-2020/)**

SIGNLL is an organization committed to the learning and exploration of various Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Topics. As one of the many subcommittees of the UIUC chapter of [ACM](acm.illinois.edu), we taught various lessons and walked through different Python projects to give a taste of this subfield of computer science. This repository contains the code and different materials for the Fall 2020 semester of SIGNLL

## Getting Started

To get the different projecs running on your machine, follow the steps below

### Installing and Opening Notebooks

First, run the following command to get the files on your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/nbalepur/SIGNLL-Fall-2020.git
```

The recommended IDE for these projects is `Jupyter Notebook`. My preferred installation method of `Jupyter Notebook` is with `Anaconda`

Instructions on how to install `Anaconda` can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Once `Anaconda` is installed, simply open up the application and type `"jupyter notebook"` into the terminal. From there, you should be able to navigate to your desired project file

### Additional Installations

Some projects require additional libraries to be installed, such as `Keras` and `Tensorflow` in the `Neural Networks` project

This can be accomplished fairly simply using `Anaconda Navigator`, instructions of which can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-tensorflow-and-keras-using-anaconda-navigator-without-command-line/)

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

An in-depth tutorial on how to run and navigate through `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

## Projects

Below you can find the different projects for SIGNLL:

### Intro to Python and NumPy

This week, we go through a brief description of NLP and the other projects we covered throughout the semester. We then showcase a notebook demo with a beginner's application to `Python` and `NumPy` We have also provided a notebook for extra practice with various `NumPy` functions and `Python` data structures. Finally, we give a brief demo of using what we've learned in a simple spam-detection model

- [Slides](./Intro%20Meeting/Intro%20Meeting%20Slides.pdf)
- [Notebook Practice (Blank)](./Intro%20Meeting/Meeting%201%20Workbook%20Blank.ipynb)
- [Notebook Practice (Filled)](./Intro%20Meeting/Meeting%201%20Workbook%20Solutions.ipynb)

#### Spam / Not Spam Demo

In this introductory demo, we take a look at how we can use the basics of `Python` to predict whether or not an email is spam or not spam

*In the following screenshot, `spam` designates a spam email and `ham` is a non-spam email*

### Linear and Logistic Regression

This week, we discuss two of the most fundamental algorithms for NLP: linear and logistic regression. We give an overview of the theory behind the regression, an explanation of data collection and model validation, and a preview of how these algorithms can be applied using tweet predictions

- [Slides](./Linear%20and%20Logistic%20Regression/Linear%20and%20Logistic%20Regression%20Slides.pdf)
- [Notebook (Blank)](./Linear%20and%20Logistic%20Regression/Linear%20and%20Logistic%20Regression%20Blank.ipynb)
- [Notebook (Filled)](./Linear%20and%20Logistic%20Regression/Linear%20and%20Logistic%20Regression%20Filled.ipynb)

#### Linear Regression Demo

If you navigate to the [SIGNLL Website](nbalepur.github.io/SIGNLL-Fall-2020) under `Linear and Logistic Regression` and `Linear Regression Demo`, you can try the following demo for yourself!

You will be taken to an interactive plot where you can add points by clicking on the plot, and delete an existing point by clicking on it. Once you are satisfied, you can press `Fit Line` to run the algorithm. Finally, you can vary the degree to see the model fit and the equation for the line will update dynamically


### Sentiment Analysis

### Neural Networks

### Chatbots (Parts 1 and 2)

### Text Summarization

### Tries

### Naive Bayes
